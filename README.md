# DEPRECATED

As of patch 6.1, The Praetorium was split into multiple dungeons, so this plugin is no longer useful. I will leave the repo here in case we ever get FF14 classic.

As you can see, different languages have different length cutscenes within The Praetorium. 

This plugin will automatically choose the fastest language for each cutscene, saving you a total of 76 seconds compared to the English cutscenes. 

This plugin only affects cutscene audio; all text will still be in your preferred language. 

When The Praetorium is over, the cutscene audio language will be reset to its original setting.
