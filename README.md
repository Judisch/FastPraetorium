# FastPraetorium
![PraetoriumCutsceneTimers](Praetorium_Cutscene_Timers.png)

As you can see, different languages have different length cutscenes within The Praetorium. 

This plugin will automatically choose the fastest language for each cutscene, saving you a total of 76 seconds compared to the English cutscenes. 

This plugin only affects cutscene audio; all text will still be in your preferred language. 

When The Praetorium is over, the language will be reset to "Adjust to Client".
